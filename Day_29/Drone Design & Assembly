# Day 29/30 â€“ SolidWorks Challenge: Drone Design & Assembly

This project is part of my **30-Day SolidWorks Challenge**. On Day 29, I worked on designing and assembling a **fully functional drone** with all its major components.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal was to create a drone model from scratch by designing each individual part in SolidWorks and then combining them into a complete assembly. This included both the mechanical structure and camera mount components.
