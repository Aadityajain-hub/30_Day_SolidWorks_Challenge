# Day 21 – Sheet Metal Design in SolidWorks

Today’s focus was on **Sheet Metal Modelling** in SolidWorks, creating multiple parts using various sheet metal features such as *Base Flange, Edge Flange, Miter Flange, Hem, Bend, and Cutouts*. These designs demonstrate manufacturing-ready models that can be directly converted into flat patterns for fabrication.

## **Projects Completed**
1. **Beam**
   - Created a structural sheet metal beam with slot and hole patterns.
   - Included flat pattern for manufacturing.
   - Practiced edge flange and cut-extrude features.

2. **Machined Bracket**
   - Designed a precision bracket with multiple bends and cutouts.
   - Used sheet metal + machined feature workflow.
   - Prepared for CNC machining after bending.

3. **Mobile Stand**
   - Developed a mobile holder from a single sheet metal piece.
   - Incorporated bend relief and hem edges.
   - Fully convertible to a flat sheet.

4. **Vented Cover**
   - Designed an enclosure with ventilation slots.
   - Applied cut-extrudes and forming tools for airflow.
   - Maintained manufacturability with minimal bend stress.

## **Skills Practiced**
- Sheet Metal Design & Flattening
- Edge Flange, Miter Flange, and Hem usage
- Bend Relief and K-Factor consideration
- Manufacturing-oriented CAD modeling
