## ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ SolidWorks Mechanical Components

### ðŸ”§ What I Practiced:
- Created **3 mechanical parts** using 2D projections
- Applied: 
  - **Sketch relations** (coincidence, concentric, symmetry)
  - **Dimensioning** for precision
  - **Extrude Boss/Base**, **Cut-Extrude**, and **Mirroring**
- Ensured views follow the **3rd Angle Projection**

Each part is fully constrained and visually documented with:
- Front, Top, and Right views
- Isometric screenshots
