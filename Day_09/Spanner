# 🔧 Day 9/30 – SolidWorks Challenge: Spanner Design

Welcome to Day 9 of my 30-Day SolidWorks Challenge!

## 🛠️ Project: Spanner (Wrench) Design

Today's task involved modeling a double-ended open spanner using precise sketching, extrusions, and fillets to match real-world proportions. It helped reinforce symmetry, handle ergonomics, and contour-driven design practices.
