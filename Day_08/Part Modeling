# 🔧 Day 8 – SolidWorks 30-Day Challenge

## 📝 Overview
In Day 8 of the SolidWorks Challenge, I focused on modeling two precision-oriented mechanical plates. The goal was to enhance skills in contour-based extrusion and internal profile cuts while maintaining dimensional accuracy and design symmetry.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SolidWorks 2024 SP1.0

## 🧩 Components Created

### 1. Offset Plate
- Features:
  - Complex perimeter profile
  - Multiple circular holes
  - Slotted feature
- Workflow:
  - Sketch → Boss-Extrude → Cut-Extrude

### 2. Frame Plate
- Features:
  - Closed rectangular loop with rounded corners
  - Internal cutout
  - Thin wall section
- Workflow:
  - Sketch outer and inner profile → Boss-Extrude → Cut inner region
