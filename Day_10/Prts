# ðŸ”§ Day 10/30: SolidWorks Challenge â€“ From Casting to Complexity

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This folder contains two mechanical models designed on Day 10 of my 30-Day SolidWorks Challenge. The goal was to practice both **casting-friendly components** and **complex bracket geometries**, focusing on functional design and real-world manufacturability.


## ðŸ§© Included Models

### 1. Casting Component
- Symmetrical design
- Cylindrical ends with a connecting rectangular rib
- Fillets applied to minimize stress concentration
- Ideal for learning **parting lines**, **draft angles**, and **basic casting principles**

### 2. Bracket Structure
- Multi-plane design with overhangs and cutouts
- Features include extruded bosses, revolved cuts, and mounting holes
- Demonstrates understanding of **structural support**, **alignment**, and **manufacturing feasibility**

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used
- SolidWorks 2024 SP1.0
- Boss-Extrude, Cut-Extrude
- Fillet tool for stress relief
- Use of reference geometry for sketch planes
- Multi-view modeling (Top, Front, Right, Isometric)
