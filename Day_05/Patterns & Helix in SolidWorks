# 📅 Day 5 – Patterns & Helix in SolidWorks

---

Focused on **repetitive geometry** and **complex curves** using SolidWorks pattern and helix tools.

Created 3 models:
- A circular plate with holes using **Circular Pattern**
- A spring using the **Helix/Spiral** feature
- A block with repeated extrusions using **Linear Pattern**

---

📸 Included:
- Front, Top, Right, and Isometric views (PNG)

🔧 Tools Used: SolidWorks 2024  
📁 Files: `/Day05/` folder contains `.SLDPRT` models and screenshots

---

✅ Reinforced skills in:
- **Circular Pattern** for radial duplication  
- **Helix** to create spiral geometry  
- **Linear Pattern** for grid-aligned features
