# Day 19 â€“ Sheet Metal Design Practice

This update showcases **five new sheet metal designs** created in SolidWorks as part of my daily CAD practice series.

## Designs

1. **Mounting Frame** *(SheetMetal_EX.6)*  
   - Purpose: Holds components securely in place.  
   - Features: Flanges for bolt connections, cutouts for weight reduction.  
   - Applications: Machinery assembly, control panels.  

2. **Power Supply Box** *(SheetMetal_EX.7)*  
   - Purpose: Encloses and protects electrical power supply units.  
   - Features: Ventilation holes, mounting tabs, foldable flanges.  
   - Applications: Industrial electronics, automation systems.  

3. **Steel Support** *(SheetMetal_EX.8)*  
   - Purpose: Provides structural reinforcement.  
   - Features: Rigid bends, precise hole placements.  
   - Applications: Structural frames, mechanical mounts.  

4. **Vent Part** *(SheetMetal_EX.9)*  
   - Purpose: Allows airflow while maintaining structural integrity.  
   - Features: Perforated holes, flange bends.  
   - Applications: HVAC ducts, enclosures, cooling systems.  

5. **Y Branch Pipe Connector** *(SheetMetal_EX.10)*  
   - Purpose: Directs fluid or air into two separate paths.  
   - Features: Angled bends, smooth transitions.  
   - Applications: Piping systems, ventilation ducts.
