# Day 02 – Part Modeling in SolidWorks

Welcome to Day 2 of my **30-Day SolidWorks Challenge**!  
Today I transitioned from 2D sketches to creating fully defined **3D part models** using core SolidWorks features.

---

## ✅ What I Did:
- Created solid models from sketches using:
  - **Extrude Boss/Base**
  - **Cut Extrude**
  - **Fillet & Chamfer**
  - **Mirror**
  - **Rib feature**
- Configured **multi-view layouts** (isometric, front, side, top)
- Modeled **8 individual parts**, maintaining clean geometry and design intent

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- **Software:** SolidWorks 2024  
- **Status:** All parts are parametric and dimensionally accurate ✅

📌 The journey continues with surface modeling, assemblies, and motion studies ahead.
