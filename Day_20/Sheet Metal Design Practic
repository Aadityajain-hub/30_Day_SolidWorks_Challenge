# Day 20 - Sheet Metal Design Practice (SolidWorks)

This folder contains my Day 20 practice files for **Sheet Metal Design** in SolidWorks.  
The focus was on creating functional components with proper sheet metal features, bends, and manufacturing considerations.

## ðŸ“‚ Components Designed
1. **Bracket**
   - Custom sheet metal bracket with mounting holes and bend reliefs.
   - Designed for easy manufacturability.
   
2. **Clevis Bracket**
   - Precision hole placement for shaft and pin connections.
   - Used edge flanges and flat pattern generation.
   
3. **Enclosure**
   - Small protective casing with ventilation cut-outs.
   - Created using base flange, tab, and forming tools.
   
4. **Reinforcement Ribs**
   - Structural support ribs to increase rigidity.
   - Optimized material usage.
