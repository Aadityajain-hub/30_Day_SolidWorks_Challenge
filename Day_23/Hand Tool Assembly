# ðŸš€ Day 23/30: SolidWorks Challenge â€“ Hand Tool Assembly

Today I practiced **Part Modelling** & **Assembly Techniques** in SolidWorks by designing and assembling a functional **Hand Pliers** model from scratch.

## Assembly:
- **Part 1:** Left Handle with integrated jaw section  
- **Part 2:** Right Handle with integrated jaw section  

This project helped me refine skills in **multi-body part design**, **mating components**, and ensuring **precise alignment** for moving mechanical parts.
