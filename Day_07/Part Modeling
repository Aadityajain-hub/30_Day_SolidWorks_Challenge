# 📅 Day 7/30 – From Sketch to Solid

**Challenge Theme:**  
Transitioning from 2D sketches to fully-featured 3D solid models using SolidWorks 2024.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Today's goal was to design a uniquely structured mechanical component from scratch — beginning with precise sketching and advancing through solid modeling features.

The focus was on:
- Understanding geometry intent before modeling
- Applying advanced sketch tools and constraints
- Turning 2D profiles into 3D models with detail and precision
