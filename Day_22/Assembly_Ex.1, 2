# ðŸš€ Day 22/30: SolidWorks Challenge â€“ Assembly Practice  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
On Day 22 of my 30-Day SolidWorks Challenge, I focused on **Part Modelling & Assembly Techniques** by creating and combining multiple custom components into functional assemblies.  
This session helped me improve constraint application, alignment accuracy, and assembly documentation skills.

## ðŸ›  Assemblies Created  

### Assembly 1  
- **Leg_Part**  
- **Step_Part**  
- **Top_Part**  

### Assembly 2  
- **Base Plate**  
- **Roller Component**  
- **Side Support**

## ðŸŽ¯ Skills Practiced  
- **Sketch & Extrude Boss/Base**  
- **Cut-Extrude for features**  
- **Mate Constraints** (Coincident, Parallel, Distance)  
- **Assembly Environment setup**  
- **2D Drawing Creation for assemblies**

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings  
- How to control part alignment using mates.  
- The importance of tolerance in assembly fit.  
- Efficient workflow between **Part** and **Assembly** environments.
