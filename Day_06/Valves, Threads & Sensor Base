# 📅 Day 6 – Valves, Threads & Sensor Base

---

Modeled realistic mechanical parts that resemble components found in fluid and sensor systems.

Created 3 models:
- A **butterfly valve body** with symmetrical flanges
- A **threaded nut** using helical cut  
- A **torque sensor base** with bolt patterns

---

📸 Included:
- Top, Front, Right, and Isometric views

🔧 Tools Used: SolidWorks 2024  
📁 Files: `/Day06/` folder contains `.SLDPRT` models and screenshots

---

✅ Reinforced skills in:
- **Helical cut for threads**  
- Modeling flange holes using **circular pattern**
- Maintaining dimensional symmetry across projections
